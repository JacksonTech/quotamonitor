quotamonitor
============

A small Linux wxWidgets allowence meter for the HughesNet HT1000 and HN9000 satellite modems.

quotamonitor is used to display the amount of monthly data allowence remaining for a
HughesNet modem. The app fetches information from the HT1000 and HN9000 (and possibly HT1100) 
series of satellite modems and displays the remaining monthly allowence as a bar graph. 

This software is not endorsed by HughesNet.
